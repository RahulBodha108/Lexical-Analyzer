# Lexical-Analyzer
This project implements a Lexical Analyzer, which converts streams of characters from a C file into lexical tokens, essential for the compilation process. It handles tokenization of words, symbols, and punctuation, along with error handling during parsing. Strengthen your skills in file I/O, file pointers, and string operations
